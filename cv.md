Biography

I'm 15 and I don't have work experience or anything like that. I strive for self-learning and self-improvement. For 3 years of various trials of fields of activity, I came to programming.

My way out with simple programs for Arduino (Robotics). This invitation was offered to me by my father. I began to understand the creation of simple programs for the simplest circuit. But since I managed that moment 12 years, I haven't been able to delve far into the research. I don't know knowledge, discovery, and much more. So I quickly dropped it all.

A year after trying out with Arduino, I decided to get into computer graphics. It is unlikely that I realized that I have no talent as an artist and a dead end for me. So after a couple of months, I gave up on that as well.

Last year I found the Construct 2 editor and tried to create my game in it. It is based on graphical code, so it was easy for me. After that, I wanted something more complex and in demand. So I decided to try my hand at programming. I chose RS School courses. It will be difficult, but I'm getting on his way!

     return "odd"
